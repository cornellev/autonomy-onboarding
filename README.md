# Autonomy Onboarding Project

Shared repository for the onboarding project for new members of the CEV autonomy subteam.

## Data

The dataset can be downloaded from [this Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tusharcode/selfdriving-car-udacity), and has a lot of images with associated direction labels. The images seem to be frames excerpted from a video, and a different analysis that Adams showed us revealed that the vast majority of the directions are pointing straight forward, which will need to be taken into account when dividing the images into training, validation, and testing sets.
